iceage
======

Upload images files from a directory to an existing vault in Amazon Glacier

You first need to install glacier-cli from https://github.com/carlossg/glacier-cli

* It only upload IMAGES, not videos. Change the grep to adapt
* videoiceage is a duplication which uploads videos instead of images. I'll of course merge them (or please do it)
* There is a know problem with path & filenames containing spaces and accents
* I hope to do a python version soon :)
